v0.5.8


-added the slider pan for many lulz
-added a naturalizing item to counter the ability of the bionic conversion item
-finally got around to fixing the age old glitch with the workers trying to pick up gravel, it was just 1 null point exception i overlooked, really simple glitch, im an idiot XD
-also changed the trigger item for worker item retrieval to a chest block, cuz it makes more sense than a stick
-tried to idiot proof how the underground cities were generated to prevent any possible overlap, seems to work fine in testing :D
-also made cities generate their chests AFTER they were fully created so chests werent destroyed when it was still generating, some associated glitches with that are naturally fixed as well.
-used this generation mechanism for crypts, now they no longer overlap in a stupid fashion but perfectly grided like giant blocks. This also fixes some chest overlap issues
-made adjacently spawned cities place a tunnel inbetween the rock, assuming theres rock in the way which hopefully there is..
-made the city's chest spawns a tiny bit more variant
-sped up frass growth in water considerably, at least 5 times faster, frass on other blocks is also a little faster but cant grow down over 2 block lengths anymore
-remodelled the crypts abit, personally i think they look better now
-added some more compatability for the 'fast' graphics option
-fixed a dumb visual glitch with water frass
-finally renamed a few classes for mobs to their REAL names, not my initial prototyping ones

v0.5.7
-finally added some more 'independent' items and means to survive on alltech biome option
-a new artificial 'plant'
-a power pickaxe item, stronger than diamond but only 3 uses :V super easy to make though
-a couple weird superpowered items of sorts
-a handful of new blocks specifically for....
-a freaking huge new world gen thing, seriously, look underground in tech biomes :]
-changed some textures
-went totally crazy and put an AM_ in front of 'almost' every class name (i have a couple good reasons though :P )
-frass now spreads to sand and water, it only spreads to water within a tech biome however (if all tech is on though, it will slowly cover the ocean >:D)
-added some variance to 'foliage array' colors
-also finally added graphics option to foliage array
-finally nerfed the healing block, big time, it's pretty balanced now with a timer based healing, it charges up and heals then you have to wait
-messed around with biome gen stuff some more
-fixed a derp glitch where solid frass would turn to clay if it was covered just like frassed clay
-fixed a silly texture glitch with the guard turret
-changed the sentry model a tiny bit, also now with silly teeth chomping action XD
-fixed a very old little visual glitch with the sliders face



v0.5.3
-fixed a pesky little glitch where dig particles didnt show up when workers dug, i fixed in the strangest fashion, but it works
hopefully... i'll probably get a mountain of bugs posted on here because of it XD
-made code more reliant on my own system
-fixed the empty handed worker bug! will now follow/idle toggle with empty hand or item they dont recognize
-slider shell can now be placed on walls or upside down for many bouncing possibilites!
-added another new entity! :D
-3 new  items, 2 being just parts for the new bot, last being a new automaton body for 'higher tier' bots like the sentry
-changed some of the stack sizes for a few bots, nothing too notable
-changed some recipes AGAIN XD
-changed where the textures are stored, all in one folder now for convenience and so i dont forget stuff again XD
-verrrrrry subtle texture changes, trying to get a slight older look to some
-started setting up for a bunch of new entities, coming soon!


v0.5.1
-modloader version! woo, took forever XD
-new item, blocks, and entity ids config file! no moar conflicts! hopefully.
-also added 'all tech biome' option, so all biomes can be mechy, if you so choose, default is off
-sentry no longer attacks tame or wild wolves, but will attack angry wolves 
-sentry also attacks slimes now
-guard attacks slimes now
-fixed a mistake where i accidently removed duplex collisions ^^


v0.5
-SOUNDS FINALLY,no more slime,skeleton, and creeper noises for my bots XD
-made alot of item changes, some ids have changed and you probably lost some stuff, sorry :[
-workers will now find coal ore when shown coal, or redstone ore when shown redstone dust, no diamond though, cuz that's too easy and im sure they'd
fuck it up and then i'd get ragers about "ZOMG YOUR @#%@# WORKER LOST MEH DIAMONDS!!!11ONE!1"
-completley rewrote worker's item finding ability, hopefully they'll work better now, I notice they wander around more but don't seem to be
getting stuck so far, please let me know if it's still terrible! XD
-added mortar? and other unrelated recipes that hardly seem to fit this mod, but i felt like it
-added another use for blue cores ^^ (new entities)
-added omni
-slider file name changed to ASLider for compatability issues
-finally added death smoke particles, since bots disapear instantly rather then the normal 'fall over' first i had to
recode a bit :B
-made the laser gun more accurate, i know i know it's getting too OP, but it's so fun!!
-made the guard turret more accurate, like stupidly accurate
-capped Bobby dupping at 50, this is 50 Bobbies in the entire world, so no way that can lag spike (there can often be 300 entities in a world)
-nerfed Bobby drops
-sentry now takes priority with keeping near the player over 14 units if targetting
-sentry also does a 'boomerang' sort of move now where if he cant seem to reach an  enemy he runs back to the owner first and refinds targets
-sentry no longer wanders around aimlessly, if he moves, he's either catching up to you, or hunting.
-fixed a glitch where choppers would constantly get stuck, especially in trees
-frass now grows onto clayblocks just like normal grass grows onto dirt! it's virtually identical, however, now when you break frass
it drops a frass block and returns the 'infected' clay to normal, but adjacent frass can grow onto it again! upon placing the frass 
again it will no longer turn to clay when harvested but will infect other clay blocks into normal frass again.. it's confusing, 
play around with it!
-the magic of metadata allows me to add blocks without using more ids! wodnerous! blue trees now have custom trunk block
-bugtesting stick thing

v0.41
-made Slider spawn less crazy(barely) only spawns on sand, grass, or fake grass
-fixed a rather bad SMP bug with fake grass
-guards should properly deploy in SMP now
-made Bobby the most overpowered little bugger imaginable! remember: still allergic to water :B
-fixed broken worker head recipe, woops ^^
-duplex duplication recipe now works properly in SMP

v0.113
-fixed some really derpy but subtle code mistakes
-made Watcher more sinister
-Watcher new drops
-Added Guard bot

v0.112
-MODLOADER SUPPORT, sheesh...
-no externally changable item id's yet.
-still learning how to make a changelog look right XD
-automatons and biters no longer wander aimlessly when following you
-automatons no longer need stick for follow or idle mode change, go barehanded!


v0.11 
-hopefully actually works now
